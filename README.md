# Java-Assignment-6-Ireland-Game

This assignment I have constructed a model that reflects the inhabitants of Ballybeg, a small town teeming with mystical creatures - Werewolves, Witches, and Humans. Each inhabitant possesses distinctive attributes and abilities, integral to their existence within this fantastical world. This assignment emphasizes the use of inheritance, assosciation, encapsulation, and various concepts of logic in Java.

At the core of every inhabitant lies a set of attributes - Strength, Agility, and Health Rating, each ranging from 1 to 10. These attributes define their capabilities and resilience. Notably, Werewolves and Witches impose constraints on attribute values upon creation, ensuring a minimum threshold for each attribute. Additionally, an inhabitant's vitality is determined by their Health Rating; if it drops to zero, they are rendered deceased, incapable of resurrection.

Werewolves, creatures of the night, are deeply ingrained in packs, led by an Alpha. They hold steadfast allegiance to their pack, fostering camaraderie and loyalty. The pack structure prohibits inter-pack hostilities but allows for alliances with lone witches. Packs thrive as unified entities, with an unyielding commitment to their hierarchical structure.

Witches, practitioners of arcane arts, possess the ability to bolster their allies with mystical energy. Through the manipulation of their Strength attribute, witches enhance the magical prowess of healers, aiding in the restoration of health and vitality.

Humans, versatile beings, assume diverse roles within the town. Healers harness magical energies to mend wounds and alleviate suffering, while Hunters exhibit prowess in combat, dealing amplified damage to adversaries. Their roles contribute significantly to the dynamic interplay within Ballybeg.

The denizens of Ballybeg engage in conflict, employing their abilities to defend and assail. In combat, the damage inflicted by an inhabitant corresponds to their intrinsic attributes, with hunters delivering intensified blows. Defensively, individuals mitigate harm through random defense values, safeguarding their well-being against assailants.
